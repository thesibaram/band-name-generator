Welcome to the **Band Name Generator**, a fun and colorful command-line tool that creates a quirky band name based on your city and pet’s name! Built using **Python** with CLI styling from [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) and a splash of ASCII charm from [Cowsay](https://pypi.org/project/cowsay/).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You enter the name of the city you grew up in. `(e.g. Dlehi)`
2. You enter your pet’s name.`(e.g. Roxy)`
3. It generates a band name like `DELHI ROXY` with colorful formatting and a cowsay cow.
